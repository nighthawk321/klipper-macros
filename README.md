I have 2 printers and planning more and here is where I am going to keep the macros that I use instead of hunting around github and else to find them again.

In the printer.config file add 
[include macros.cfg] under the line
[include mainsail.cfg]

it should look like-
[include mainsail.cfg]
[include macros.cfg]
